## Introduction

**What is this?** It’s a curation of open-source Ghost Themes. It’s actually a very opiniated classification of ghost themes. The question I ask myself is: **Would I recommand this theme to a friend or a client ?** If it’s not a Hell yes! kind of reaction, I move the theme I’m reviewing in the [03_no-go directory](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection-No-Go/tree/master/03_no-go).

## Two main git repo:

1. The main git repo [is here](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection).
2. The NoGo git repo [is here](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection-No-Go).
